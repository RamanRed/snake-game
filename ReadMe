# 🐍 Snake Game in Python using Turtle

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic version of the Snake Game, developed in Python using the Turtle Graphics library. The game is simple yet addictive, where the player controls a snake to eat food, and the snake grows in size as it consumes more. The objective is to score as high as possible without crashing into the walls or the snake's own body.

 🎮 Features

- Smooth Controls: Responsive keyboard controls for snake movement (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as the snake eats food.
- Difficulty Increases: The snake grows longer as it eats, making the game more challenging.
- End Game Condition: Game over when the snake collides with itself or the game boundary.
- Simple Graphics: Uses the Turtle library for simple, clean, and colorful graphics.
